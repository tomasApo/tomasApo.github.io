Hey guys, I'm an Engineer originally from  ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ currently living in the ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. I recently graduated with a degree in Product Design Engineering from Loughborough University. While I once showcased a collection of my projects from my student years, I've since embarked on a rewarding journey as a Hardware Engineer in Cambridge, UK. Now, my portfolio reflects my passion for creating innovative solutions more focused on electronics. 

If you find something intriguing or have any questions about my work, please don't hesitate to reach out.
