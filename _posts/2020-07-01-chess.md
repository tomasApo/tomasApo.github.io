In my final years of high school, I started getting into 3D printing and woodworking. 

Here I designed a chess board with 3d printed pieces of different densities. Meaning even visually impared users could tell the difference between a white castle and a black castle 


| White castle (30% infill)                          | black castle (100% infill)                      |
