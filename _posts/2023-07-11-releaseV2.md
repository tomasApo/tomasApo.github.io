# Release the Electronic Trolley Lock for supermarkets

## Overview
- In the UK, over half a million shopping trolleys are abandoned annually.
- It costs British businesses [£35m a year](https://www.wanzl.com/en_GB/360-degree-service/TrolleyWise), and that doesnt include environmental damages!
- Here is the engineering development to get to the finished prototype.


### Methodology

## Altium PCB Design

### DC to DC power supply 
A power supply board was made to test TI DC to DC converters chips for my power requirements. I designed a dev board with two power rails, a 3.3v 200mA high effeciency rail and a higher power 5v 1A for the servo.
- 5v rail 
  - [TPS61023](https://www.ti.com/product/TPS61023)
  - Boost converter

- 3.3v rail
  - ~~[TPS61098](https://www.ti.com/product/TPS61098)~~ [TPS63051](https://www.ti.com/product/TPS63051)
  -  Synchronous boost converter with integrated LDO

> This was a lovely development for introduction to DC-DC converters and to distinguish buck from boost converters

## Code & Firmware
> **Why did you choose rust instead of C?**

Good question, I chose rust for the following reasons.


1. Safety. It basically meant that it was extremely hard for me to introduce memory safety bugs, even with my lack of embedded experience!
1. Rust is a new language compared to C. It let me personally find out what all the fuss is about. 
1. Rust is backed by a great community. Meaning help was only a few tickets away. 
  1. Most importantly A driver for the RFID reader I was using already existed [MFRC522](https://crates.io/crates/mfrc522),

## Hardware development Phase 4.

### *Locking Mechanism*
For the trolley to be locked and unlocked, I needed to design a mechanism that could be controlled by a microcontroller instead of a 1£ coin. Initial concept was a Slider crank mechanism where we convert the rotational displace from a servo to a forward displacement to push a pin into the key.

> Slider crank mechanism required 3 joins, which would wear down overtime and require lubrication. For a mass produced product, this is not idea.

#### *Compliant Mechanism*
Exploring compliant mechanisms became the logical next step, especially with the accessibility of a 3D printer, aiming to overcome the setbacks encountered with the slider crank mechanism. The iterative process is vividly captured in the following two images:

#### *Comparison of O-Ring and Gasket Designs*
- The intended solution from ReleaseV1 was to split the case at the seam to hide the split lines.
- Due to all the organic angles and corves this made designing the gasket complicated

*Solution: O-ring Design!*

  {% for i in (1..4) %}
    <div style="flex: 0.2; text-align: center;">

      <p> {{ i }}</p>
    </div>
  {% endfor %}

- Initial thoughts were using aluminium but once I started manufacturing I quickly realised how soft and easy to work with aluminium was... not an ideal material to use for a secure lock.
