# Release the Electronic Trolley Lock for supermarkets

## Overview
- In the UK, over half a million shopping trolleys are abandoned annually.
- It costs British businesses [£35m a year](https://www.wanzl.com/en_GB/360-degree-service/TrolleyWise), and that doesnt include environmental damages!
- Here is the engineering development to get to the finished prototype.


### Methodology
![Methodology](/assets/img/ReleaseV2/methodology_overview_v2.png)

## Hardware & CAD Design
- Showcase the physical design, CAD, and enclosure features.
- Use images or 3D renderings to provide a visual overview.

## Altium PCB Design

### DC to DC power supply 
A power supply board was made to test TI DC to DC converters chips for my power requirements. I designed a dev board with two power rails, a 3.3v 200mA high effeciency rail and a higher power 5v 1A for the servo.
- 5v rail 
  - [TPS61023](https://www.ti.com/product/TPS61023)
  - Boost converter

- 3.3v rail
  - ~~[TPS61098](https://www.ti.com/product/TPS61098)~~ [TPS63051](https://www.ti.com/product/TPS63051)
  -  Synchronous boost converter with integrated LDO

```bash
.
├── build.rs
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── memory.x
├── src
│   └── main.rs
└── target
    └── thumbv7em-none-eabihf (to generated binary for ARM Cortex-M3)
        ├── CACHEDIR.TAG
        └── debug
```

<!-- ## Testing & Validation
