## Introduction

The European bi-liquid student rocketry team **DanSTAR** approached me to design, prototype, and test a complete battery system to power their entire rocket. This request came after **EuRoC’s recent regulation changes**, which **banned Lithium-Polymer (LiPo) batteries** due to their increased flammability and fire hazard risks.  

> **"Lithium-Polymer (LiPo) batteries are not allowed due to the increased flammability and thus an increased fire hazard."**  
> — [EuRoC Safety Regulations](https://euroc.pt/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PTS_EDU_EuRoC_ST_000455_DTEG_v05.pdf)

## System Requirements

- **Nominal Voltage:** 24V  
- **Power Demand:** Previous launch system required **284W peak power**  
  - Using $$ P = V \cdot I $$ $$\rightarrow$$ $$I_{max} = \frac{284}{24} =$$**11.8A**  
- **Redundancy:** Modular packs designed for parallel operation  
- **Communication:** SPI/CAN interface with the rest of the system  
- **Battery Chemistry:** LiFePO4 (for safety and compliance)  

## Battery Selection

Finding a **reliable** LiFePO4 supplier with **transparent pricing and proper datasheets** turned out to be surprisingly difficult. **Batteryspace.com** stood out due to its excellent documentation.  

The **[LFP-18650-1800](https://www.batteryspace.com/prod-specs/9736-LFP-18650-1800.pdf)** was selected with the following characteristics:  

- **Capacity:** 1800 mAh @ 0.5C  
- **Max Continuous Discharge:** 9A (for short-term loads, e.g., servo movements)  
- **Pack Configuration:** 7S1P per module, expandable in parallel

## Mechanical Problem 

- After talking to structures team, it was evident that the design of packs arranged in a star formation would abstruct piping and make securing packs to frame dififcult as centrally there is no mechanical fixture.

Solution:
- **Half Banana** having the packs arranged near the circumfrance and mounting rings made securing it to the rocket far easier.

## Solution

The designed system consists of **modular** battery packs that can be **stacked in parallel** for redundancy and increased power output.  

### Key Features:
- **7S1P LiFePO4 configuration** per pack  
- **Custom-designed BMS** using the **BQ76942**  
- **Parallel-capable architecture** for increased redundancy  
- **SPI communication**

## Conclusion & Next Steps

Testing is ongoing! More updates will be added once validation is complete.

<!-- ## Mathematics  

This site supports **MathJax** for rendering equations:  

$$
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
  \label{eq:series}
\end{equation}
$$  

We can reference the equation as \eqref{eq:series}.  

For example, solving the quadratic equation:

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$   -->
