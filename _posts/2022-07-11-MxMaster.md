#### Logitech have been refreshing their MX master mouse for the past few years. Releasing 1 mouse every few years. With the only actual feature updating being USB C on their latest MX Master s3. At a whopping price of **110Â£!**

## Testing 
- Testing is currently done 1 by 1 with my multimeter probes and a 5v USB C pd charger. This testing method works but is extremely slow.

### DFM Automated PCB Panel Testing:
- Future idea is to design a DFM Automated PCB Panel Testing rig. 
- Where the user after soldering the two rows of boards, hooks up the multimeter to the two pads, then goes one by one plugging the connector into each board validating they give power before snaping them off
