title: Mx Master conversion 
description: Upgrade your Logitech Mx master for a fraction of the cost of a new mouse. Logitech has been quite lazy and its only significant upgrade has been the inclusion of USB-C in their latest model, the MX Master s3, priced at a hefty Â£110!

## Testing 
- Testing is currently done 1 by 1 with my multimeter probes and a 5v USB C pd charger. This testing method works but is extremely slow.

### DFM Automated PCB Panel Testing:
- Future idea is to design a DFM Automated PCB Panel Testing rig. 
- Where the user after soldering the two rows of boards, hooks up the multimeter to the two pads, then goes one by one plugging the connector into each board validating they give power before snaping them off
